## Smart Anchor Positioning

Anchor a floating element next to another element while making sure it stays in view by **avoiding collisions**. This lets you position tooltips, popovers, or dropdowns optimally.

```toml,trunk
package = "floating-ui-book"
features = ["arrow", "flip", "placement", "shift", "size", "virtual"]
```
